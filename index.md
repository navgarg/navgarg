Google Code-in (GCI) is an annual programming competition hosted by Google LLC that introduces pre-university students to the world of open source and allows them to complete bite-sized tasks specified by various, partnering open source organizations. 

This is the first time I participated in Google Code In. I’d turned 13 in 2019, so, I got eligible this year itself. I was always interested in cartography, so I chose to work with OSGeo, which is a non-profit organization. 
On 2nd December, 2019, when the contest was about to begin, I was scared. I had never contributed to the open source community before. But, as I started doing some tasks, I understood how things worked, and now, it seems really easy to contribute to the community. I have learnt a lot of things during the contest. I could never have imagined that I would be able to proceed with making videos. Mentors were always behind my back to guide me and help me with anything I couldn’t do on my own. 
Among the tasks I completed, the easy tasks were really fun to do. However, the challenging tasks took a little time. I had to ask mentors for help. Sometimes, I felt really dumb, as I was not able to think and find out a way even with the mentor helping me. But, all mentors of OSGeo are helpful; they motivated me to continue working to complete the task.
I now feel proud of my decision to work with OSGeo. From this Google CodeIn contest, I have learnt a lot about OSGeo and also about the open source world. I have learnt how big projects like GeoNode and GRASS are built, with the collective contribution of hundreds of people. Anyone can report an error by opening an issue and suggest changes to the code.
I look forward to participate in GCI next year, and hope to learn more new things in future.
